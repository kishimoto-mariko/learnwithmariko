Hello Everyone,

This is Mariko from Japan, and welcome You to my very new website which I created with [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

I will post how I learn statistics and genomics using R and other tools. I will also post my participations in TidyTuesday!

```{r}

  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_colour_ghibli_d("LaputaMedium", direction = -1)
```
